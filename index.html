        <p>
            Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. 
            It's the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, oceans of water on its surface and, of course, life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Earth is the fifth largest of the planets in the solar system. 
            It's smaller than the four gas giants — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — but larger than the three other rocky planets, Mercury, Mars and Venus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Earth has a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers) and is round because gravity pulls matter into a ball. 
            But, it's not perfectly round. 
            Earth is really an "oblate spheroid," because its spin causes it to be squashed at its poles and swollen at the equator.

        <p>Planet earth population consist of approx. 2 billions people. 
                There are many continents and countries that spread all over the earth.
                From those many continents and countries, many ethnicities, races, languages, and religions were born.
                People been all over the earth is living peacefuly, untul certain issues and wars happened.
                The world war as we called it are already happened twice on earth. The world war I and world war II
             </p>
             <p>These wars happened because some of the people on earth are taking advantage over the others.
                Such as in the need of conquering another countries to obtain their valuable resources and people.
                Luckily these world wars are over, but there are still many indications that stated that these wars are still happened.
             </p>
             <p>
                 After the world war ended, many countries declared independence.
                 From there politics were born.
                 Politic is about how to manage the countries and their resources, thus include governance and resource handling.
                 Since politic was born, there were many pros and cons about this.
                 Many people that go to politics is actually managing their countries well.
                 But still there are some downside to this, that people taking advantage of power in a country.
